# Password-database-With-special-stuff
This program can:
Generate passwords and pincodes
Generate Encryption keys
Encrypt files
Decrypt files(If you have the original encryption key, no bruteforce option exists)
Store passwords or other text based information "securely" (I higly doubt this program is totally safe, as i am very beginner at programming and security)

Recuired Libraries: (Libraries that come with python are not stated below)

Numpy: https://numpy.org/install/

Fernet: https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/

sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

Termcolor: https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/


How To Use:
First i recommend putting these files in a folder inly cointaing the program files, and to have a Encryprtion key on a USB-Stick.
If you want "super security", i recommend using the program on a offline pc, or mini computer like a raspberry pi.


General info about each part of the program:


    1---See how to use this program: Basic info about the program, you will see the this and the following text.

    2---Create a Password: Creates a password, you can choose how many uppercase and lowercase letters you want invidualy, 
        and then you can chose how many numbers you want (0 - 9)
        then how many of these @ ! $ # symbols it should contain,
        And lastly, you can Add what ever you heart desires.

    3---Create a Pincode: You can choose the length of the pincode

    4---Create an Encryption Key: You will create a key with 128-bit AES encryption in CBC mode, PKCS7 padding, it will be placed in the fodler where you have all  the program files
        You will get to choose the files name, and the program will automatically make it a .key file (You don't need to install anything for .key files so ignore any, windows telling you that the file type is unsupported, cause you will never have to actually open it)

    5---See Database: In this option you will be able to see and edit the database trough the program.
        Removing trough the program is kinda wonky at first, but it very simple, and it will look something like this
        ['0This is the database\n', '1-----------------------\n', '2\n', '3TESTPASSWORD1\n', '4TESTPASSWORD2\n', '5TESTPASSWORD3\n', '6TESTPASSWORD4\n', '7TESTPASSWORD5\n']
        The number at the start of each Hard Bracket[] is the row, you don't have to ad that, it is done automaticaly by the program (The number is not permanent,and is NOT a added to the actual database, but rather a varible copy of it), 
        So to remove for example TESTPASSWORD3 you'd type 5 and hit enter in the ''remove from the database'' option.
        Other than that, the database is pretty self explanitory.
    
    6---Encrypt a file: This option will allow you to encrypt a file using a key generated by the programs 4:th option, 
        you can choose to have only a enrcypted file, or to have a un-encrypted copy along side the encrypted one
    
    7---Decrypt a file: You can decrypt AES encrypted files aslong as you have the key used to encrypted them, 
        here you will get a Un-encrypted copy of the file, the original will remain encrypted
    
    8---Stop the program: I bet you can't guess what this one does
